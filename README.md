Fork of the CPHDH TourBuilder project meant to expose the Tours via Omeka's rest API

The purpose of the modifications is to make this plugin appropriate for use with a mobile application. 
This means that the tours will be exposed over omeka's rest api, and that more capacity for sorting
will be added to the server. In particular, tours can be sorted according to distance from a point.
